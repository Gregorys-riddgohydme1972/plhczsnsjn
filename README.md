Oh man, just finished watching Alarum, and I'm like... what did I just see? 😂 It’s one of those movies that kinda leaves you going in circles, you know what I mean? I’m not even sure if I’m using my brain correctly trying to process it. It's like, you see this scene and you're like “wait, were they actually going there or am I just dreaming?” You get sucked into their little universe and by the end, you're just like, “okay, cool, that was something.” 

Seriously, it's like they mashed together a bunch of random ideas and hoped it all mixed well. Can't even say if it did or not. 🤷‍♀️ And the acting, don’t even get me started. It’s like they tried so hard but also didn't try at all, you know? Anyway, I'm sitting here like maybe I should download the movie again and see if it all clicks the second time around.

And then there's that one bit with the music – one track is all dramatic and then suddenly, you’re like in a silent vacuum where sound doesn’t exist anymore. You just sit there eating your popcorn like, “Um, hello? Is my sound system broken or is this a new trend?” 😅

> You know those scenes where they just stare at each other for, like, an eternity, and you’re trying to figure out who’s going to blink first? Yeah, a lot of that. Maybe that’s supposed to be deep or something, but I'm like, “just do something!” It’s like they expect us to feel this bubbling tension but instead, I’m over here giggling ‘cause it’s almost comical how long they drag it out.

Oh, and don’t forget those weird futuristic vibes they tossed in there. Made me feel like I was stuck in some sci-fi mash-up. But not in a bad way, just in a “huh, this is happening” kind of way. Visuals were dope though, gave me a bit of a chill — or maybe that was just my overworked brain doing its thing.

Random thought: Imagine if you could watch the movie with a pre-constructed guide to explain what the heck is going on every five minutes. 😂 Might actually save some poor souls from overthinking themselves into oblivion. 

function senseOfConfusion() { return “true”; } // Why did I even write this?

Anyway, I might just crash now ‘cause my brain officially clocked out. 😴 If you end up watching it, promise to share your confused thoughts too! We'll start a club. Cheers to motion pictures that make us question our sanity. 🍿
